# Musical Structure App
This is the structure of a music app using Intents, New Activities, ArrayLists, Loops and Custom Classes.
The goal is to design and layout the flow for the structure of a Music Player app.

## What I learned? ##
This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

* Designing an app experience to achieve a certain goal
* Creating new activities
* Using explicit Intents to link between activities in your app
* Using OnClickListeners to add behavior to buttons using Java code.
* Creating your own Custom Class
* Looping through an ArrayList
* Populating a ListView or GridView with an ArrayAdapter
